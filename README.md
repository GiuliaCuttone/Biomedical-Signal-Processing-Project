# ECG signal conditioning by morphological filtering
Biomedical-Signal-Processing-Project

Clinically obtained electrocardiographics (ECG) signals are often contaminated with different types of noise and baseline drifting commonly occurs.
A modified morphological filtering (MMF) technique is used for signal conditioning in order to accomplish baseline correction and noise suppression with minimum signal distortion.
